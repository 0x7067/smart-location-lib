Smart Location Library
======================

Android library project that intends to simplify the usage of location providers and activity recognition with a nice fluid API.

**Supported Android versions**: Android 2.3+

Getting started
---------------

You should add this to your dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'io.nlopez.smartlocation:library:3.0.0'
```

Usage
-----

## Location

### Starting

For starting the location service, you should run:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location().start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

If you just want to get a single location (not periodic) you can just use the oneFix modifier. Example:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location().oneFix().start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

### Stopping

For stopping the location you could use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location().stop();
````

## Activity

### Starting

For starting the activity recognition service, you should run:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition().start(new OnActivityUpdatedListener() { ... });

### Stopping

For stopping the activity recognition you could use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition().stop();
````
