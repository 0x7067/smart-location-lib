Smart Location Library
======================

[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Smart%20Location%20Library-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1321) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrmans0n/smart-location-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrmans0n/smart-location-lib)

Android library project that intends to simplify the usage of location providers and activity recognition with a nice fluid API.

**Supported Android versions**: Android 2.3+

Adding to your project
----------------------

You should add this to your dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'io.nlopez.smartlocation:library:3.0.5'
```

If you are already using Google Play Services in your project and have problems compiling, you can try setting the transitive property to false:

```groovy
compile ('io.nlopez.smartlocation:library:3.0.5'){
	transitive = false
}
```

## Location

### Starting

For starting the location service:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location()
    .start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

If you just want to get a single location (not periodic) you can just use the oneFix modifier. Example:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location()
    .oneFix()
    .start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

### Stopping

For stopping the location just use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location().stop();
````

### Location strategy

There are three presets for location parameters:

* `LocationParams.BEST_EFFORT` (default)
* `LocationParams.NAVIGATION`
* `LocationParams.LAZY`

You can change it (if you want one other than the default one) by using the `config(locationParams)` modifier.

If you want to add some custom parameters for the distances or times involved in the location strategy, you can create your own LocationParams class.

### Changing providers

There are some providers shipped with the library.

* `LocationGooglePlayServicesProvider` (default). This will use the Fused Location Provider.
* `LocationManagerProvider` This is the legacy implementation that uses LocationManager.
* `LocationBasedOnActivityProvider` This allows you to use the activity recognition system to modify the location strategy depending on the activity changes (if the user is walking, running, on a car, a bike...).

You can implement your own if you want. That's ideal if you wanted to use a mock one for testing or something like that, or add support to another possible provider.

Example:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location()
    .provider(new LocationBasedOnActivityProvider(callback))
    .start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

## Activity

### Starting

For starting the activity recognition service, you should run:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition()
    .start(new OnActivityUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

### Stopping

For stopping the activity recognition you could use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition().stop();
````

## Geofencing

This is still experimental. Please don't use this feature in production yet :)

We can add geofences and receive the information when we enter, exit or dwell in a Geofence. The geofences are defined by a GeofenceModel, and you should use the requestId as a identifier.

We can add and remove geofences with a similar syntax as all the others.

````java
GeofenceModel mestalla = new GeofenceModel.Builder("id_mestalla")
    .setTransition(Geofence.GEOFENCE_TRANSITION_ENTER)
    .setLatitude(39.47453120000001)
    .setLongitude(-0.358065799999963)
    .setRadius(500)
    .build();

GeofenceModel cuenca = new GeofenceModel.Builder("id_cuenca")
    .setTransition(Geofence.GEOFENCE_TRANSITION_EXIT)
    .setLatitude(40.0703925)
    .setLongitude(-2.1374161999999615)
    .setRadius(2000)
    .build();

SmartLocation.with(context).geofencing()
    .add(mestalla)
    .add(cuenca)
    .remove("already_existing_geofence_id")
    .start(new OnGeofencingTransitionListener() { ... });
````
