Smart Location Library
======================

[![Android Arsenal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android%20Arsenal-Smart%20Location%20Library-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/1321)

Android library project that intends to simplify the usage of location providers and activity recognition with a nice fluid API.

**Supported Android versions**: Android 2.3+

Getting started
---------------

You should add this to your dependencies:

```groovy
compile 'io.nlopez.smartlocation:library:3.0.0'
```

Usage
-----

## Location

### Starting

For starting the location service, you should run:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location()
    .start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

If you just want to get a single location (not periodic) you can just use the oneFix modifier. Example:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location()
    .oneFix()
    .start(new OnLocationUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

### Stopping

For stopping the location you could use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).location().stop();
````

### Location strategy

There are three presets for location parameters: LocationParams.BEST_EFFORT, LocationParams.NAVIGATION and LocationParams.LAZY. By default, this will use the BEST_EFFORT one.

If you want to add some custom parameters for the distances or times involved in the location strategy, you can provide a custom LocationParams class, with the `config(yourParams)` modifier.

### Changing providers

There are some providers shipped with the library.

* LocationGooglePlayServicesProvider (default). This will use the Fused Location Provider.
* LocationManagerProvider. This is the legacy implementation that uses LocationManager.
* LocationBasedOnActivityProvider. This allows you to use the activity recognition system to modify the location strategy depending on the activity changes (if the user is walking, running, on a car, a bike...).

You can implement your own if you want and feed it to the library.

## Activity

### Starting

For starting the activity recognition service, you should run:

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition()
    .start(new OnActivityUpdatedListener() { ... });
````

### Stopping

For stopping the activity recognition you could use the stop method.

````java
SmartLocation.with(context).activityRecognition().stop();
````

## Geofencing

This is still experimental.
